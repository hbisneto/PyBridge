# PyBridge 2.0
###### Last repository update: 12/11/2022

With PyBridge it is possible to run Python scripts by bridging the code implemented in the project created with other platforms.

With PyBridge it is possible to create scripts that will run on:

1. **Linux**;
2. **macOS**;
3. **Windows**;

**PyBridge is a program entirely developed in Python. To run the program, open the `__main__.py` file located at the root of this project.**

> Note:
>> PyBridge was born from Python 3.9. For this reason, the same version of Python (version 3.9) or higher is recommended to run the system.

PyBridge has a standard ***error handling*** library that can run in any environment. Every method implemented within the library can be called from any part of the code. That way, it is not necessary to implement the ```raise RuntimeError()``` exception call inside the program's runtime library. Just import the module and reference the function call according to the treatment that must be executed.

> Note: Read more about the `exception` module in **PyBridge Modules** below.

#

## PyBridge Modules

The following modules are part of PyBridge:

* **exception:** The module contains two files with the purpose of raising errors generated by the program, in addition to checking minimum requirements for execution.
    - **Exceptions**: This library contains events that are raised when the program execution needs to be interrupted.

* **linux:** The module contains four libraries organized to run the program in a Linux environment
    - **Linux.py**: Codes implemented in this library will be executed before the Main Script.
    - **LinuxApp.py**: This library is used to implement code that will run in the Linux environment
    - **FileSystem.py**: This library contains default directories in Linux environments
    - **SplashScreen.py**: This library contains information about your project

* **mac:** The module contains four libraries organized to run the program on macOS
    - **Mac.py**: Codes implemented in this library will be executed before the Main Script.
    - **MacApp.py**: This library is used to implement code that will run on macOS
    - **FileSystem.py**: This library contains standard macOS directories
    - **SplashScreen.py**: This library contains information about your project

* **system:** The module contains two files with the purpose of raising errors generated by the program, in addition to checking minimum requirements for execution.
    - **Requirements**: This library contains events that are raised when the program execution needs to be interrupted.

* **windows:** The module contains four libraries organized to run the program on Windows
    - **Windows.py**: Codes implemented in this library will be executed before the Main Script.
    - **WindowsApp.py**: This library is used to implement code that will run on Windows

## Native Libraries

The following libraries were used to implement the tool:

* **codecs:** The module defines functions for encoding and decoding with any codec.
    - Read more about the ```codecs``` library at [codecs — Codec registry and base classes](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/codecs.html)

* **datetime:** The ```datetime``` module provides the classes for handling dates and times.
    - Read more about the ```datetime``` library at [datetime — Basic date and time types](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/datetime.html)

* **getpass:** Portable password input.
    - Read more about the ```getpass``` library at [getpass — Portable Password Input](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/getpass.html)

* **os:** This module provides a simple way to use functionality that is OS dependent.
    - Read more about the ```os``` library at [os — Miscellaneous operating system interfaces](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/os.html)

* **pathlib:** This module offers classes representing filesystem paths with semantics appropriate for different operating systems. Path classes are divided between pure paths, which provide purely computational operations without I/O, and concrete paths, which inherit from pure paths but also provide I/O operations.
    - Read more about the ```pathlib``` library at [pathlib — Object-oriented filesystem paths](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/pathlib.html)

* **shutil:** The shutil module provides several high-level operations on files and file collections. In particular, functions are provided that support copying and removing files. For operations on individual files, see also the **os** module.
    - Read more about the ```shutil``` library at [shutil — High-level file operations](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/shutil.html)

* **subprocess:** The subprocess module allows you to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes. This module intends to replace several older modules and functions
    - Read more about the ```subprocess``` library at [subprocess — Subprocess management](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/subprocess.html)

* **sys:** This module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.
    - Read more about the ```sys``` library at [sys — System-specific parameters and functions](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/sys.html)

* **time:** This module provides various time-related functions. For related functionality, see also the [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/datetime.html) and [calendar](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/calendar.html) modules.
    - Read more about the ```time``` library at [time — Time access and conversions](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/time.html)

* **zipfile:** The ZIP file format is a common archive and compression standard. This module provides tools to create, read, write, append, and list a ZIP file. Any advanced use of this module will require an understanding of the format, as defined in [PKZIP Application Note](https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT).
    - Read more about the ```zipfile``` library at [zipfile — Work with ZIP archives](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/zipfile.html)

## Third Party Libraries

The following libraries were used to implement the tool:

* **tweepy:** An easy-to-use library for accessing the Twitter API.
    - Read more about the ```tweepy``` library at [tweepy — An easy-to-use Python library for accessing the Twitter API](https://docs.tweepy.org/en/stable/)

> The use of the tweepy library is optional and only mandatory in cases of "Twitter Application Project" created in PyBridge.

#

* **requests:** Requests is an elegant and simple HTTP library for Python, built for human beings.
    - Read more about the ```requests``` library at [Requests: HTTP for Humans™](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)

## Update Logs (Released Versions)

For more information about update logs, access [RELEASES](https://github.com/hbisneto/PyBridge/releases) page on this repository.

## New on PyBridge 2.1:

- **Added "Install Dependencies" feature:** Now, when you run PyBridge, all the system dependencies (like Python Libraries and Modules) will be installed globally.
<br><br>
You can prevent dependencies to be installed by commenting the code on System Module Libraries (linux, mac and windows).

	```
	## Mac File (PyBridge > mac > Mac.py)
	## This file is used to implement code used to run scripts for Mac
	## Codes implemented here, will run before the script starts running
	
	import os
	from mac import Core
	from mac import FileSystem
	
	def Mac():
	    ## NOTE: You can use this function
	    ## To load information before the app starts running

	    ## Lets run the SplashScreen
	    from mac import SplashScreen
	
	    ## Lets check system requirements
	    from system import Requirements
	
	    ### YOU JUST NEED TO RUN ONCE: Be sure you commented this code after first run
	    Requirements.InstallDependencies()
	    ### YOU JUST NEED TO RUN ONCE: Be sure you commented this code after first run
	    
	    ## Start App for Mac
	    from mac import MacApp
	```

- **Improvements in PyBridge README file:** Added information about new native library `subprocess`
- Improvements in some files created by PyBridge when creating a new project
- **Added new "Create Core" feature:** Now PyBridge syncs the Core.py library from all systems. It's just choose the main Core.py file and it will be copied to another system modules dealing with necessary imports.
- Improved System Logs (in `Logs.py`)
- Improved System Requirements (in `Requirements.py`): 
	- Added new `InstallDependencies` function. 
	- Removed `CheckMajorVersion` and `CheckMinorVersion` functions from library (added `CheckVersion` function instead)
